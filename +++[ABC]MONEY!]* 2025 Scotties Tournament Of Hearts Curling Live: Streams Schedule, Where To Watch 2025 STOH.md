2025 Scotties Tournament of Hearts Preview
Selena Sturmay and her Alberta rink are heading to the 2025 Scotties Tournament of Hearts in Thunder Bay with high expectations. After a breakout performance at the 2024 Hearts in Calgary, where they reached the final four before falling to Manitoba’s Kate Cameron in the Page 3-4 playoff, Sturmay’s team is poised to make another deep run.

Sturmay’s squad—featuring Danielle Schmiemann, Dezaray Hawes, and Paige Papley—earned their spot in Thunder Bay without having to navigate the provincial championship, thanks to Chelsea Carey’s team disbanding. This pre-qualified berth has given them extra time to prepare and refine their game under the guidance of coach Ted Appleman.

Sturmay’s team is known for their precision and composure under pressure, and their experience from last year’s playoff run will be invaluable. With Schmiemann’s steady play at third, Hawes’ consistency at second, and Papley’s sharp shooting at lead, this Alberta rink has the tools to challenge the tournament favorites.
